# Bayes-habitat-model
We present a Bayesian habitat suitability modelling framework, that allows for integration of scientific knowledge, GIS data, and citizen science data, contributing to dynamic modelling of habitat suitability and species distributions. Our method can serve as a decision support tool in the management and reintroduction of threatened species.

The folder contains two R scripts: "Simulations.r" and "Analysis.r". The simulations file cannot be run without access to the field observations that are stored on the Focus app of Sensing Clues Wildlife Foundation (https://sensingclues.org/). Nonetheless, the R script may give some insight in the procedure of the Monte-Carlo simulations that were used to generate habitat suitability maps for bears in Italy, based on empirical observations, a prior habitat suitability map based on scientific insights, and the Corine Land Cover map by te Copernicus Land Monitoring Service
The raw data that came out of these simulations are stored in the folder 'Data'. These maps can be loaded in R with the "Analysis.r" file. This script reads all the maps produced in the simulations and can be used to visualise the data, and to assess model performance.
